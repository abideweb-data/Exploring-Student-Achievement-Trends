## 📘 Project Overview
**Exploring Student Achievement Trends** analyzes students’ academic performance across **Math**, **Reading**, and **Writing** to uncover factors influencing achievement levels.  

The goal is to derive insights using **Excel** for data analysis and **Power BI** for visualization, focusing on gender, parental education, test preparation, and lunch types.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify patterns in student performance across subjects.  
- Determine the influence of demographics and preparation on scores.  
- Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for decision-making.
